# Hackathon Pitch – Unbias

Problem:
Most computer vision systems that analyze people
sacrifice privacy and force oversimplified labels.

Insight:
Human perception is uncertain.
AI systems should reflect that uncertainty.

Solution:
Unbias estimates participant counts and gender presentation
without identifying individuals,
using probabilistic modeling and explicit abstention.

What Makes It Different:
- No facial recognition
- No identity inference
- No forced binary labels
- Confidence-aware aggregation
- Built-in ethical limits

Why It Matters:
Unbias demonstrates that computer vision
can be powerful without being invasive.

Closing Line:
Unbias doesn’t claim to see the truth.
It knows when to stay silent.
