# What Makes Unbias Different

Most existing systems that perform gender-based counting:

- Force binary gender labels
- Hide uncertainty
- Use facial features implicitly
- Optimize accuracy at the cost of dignity

Unbias takes a different approach.

## Key Differentiators

1. Uncertainty is a valid output
2. Probabilistic aggregation replaces hard counting
3. Privacy is enforced architecturally
4. The system can refuse to predict
5. Limitations are explicit and visible

## Design Philosophy

Unbias does not claim to observe truth.

It models perception —
and acknowledges when perception fails.

This makes it suitable for ethical research,
education, and demonstration — not surveillance.
